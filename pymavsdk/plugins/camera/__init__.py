"""
Can be used to manage cameras that implement the MAVLink
 Camera Protocol: https://mavlink.io/en/protocol/camera.html.

 Currently only a single camera is supported.
 When multiple cameras are supported the plugin will need to be
 instantiated separately for every camera and the camera selected using
 `select_camera`.
