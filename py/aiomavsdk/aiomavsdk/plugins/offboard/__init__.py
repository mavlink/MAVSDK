"""
Control a drone with position, velocity, attitude or motor commands.

 The module is called offboard because the commands can be sent from external sources
 as opposed to onboard control right inside the autopilot "board".

 Client code must specify a setpoint before starting offboard mode.
 Mavsdk automatically sends setpoints at 20Hz (PX4 Offboard mode requires that setpoints
 are minimally sent at 2Hz).
