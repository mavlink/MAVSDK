## Description

[MAVSDK](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/develop/en/) is a set of libraries providing a high-level API to [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/).
It aims to be:
- Easy to use with a simple API supporting both synchronous (blocking) API calls and asynchronous API calls using callbacks.
- Fast and lightweight.
- Cross-platform (Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android).
- Extensible (using compile-time plugins).
- Fully compliant with the MAVLink common microservices standard/definitions.

The core library is written in C++ and is used as the common "backend" to auto-generated front end libraries for different programming languages. The generated libraries share similar APIs (because they are autogenerated from a common interface) but follow idiomatic patterns expected by end users (for example, the Python library is installed from PyPi using *pip*, and includes everything you need to get up and running).

This repo contains the source code for the C++ core.
Other important repos include:
- [MAVSDK-Proto](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Proto) - Collection of proto files used by gRPC in MAVSDK (common interface definitions)
- [MAVSDK-Python](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python) - MAVSDK client for Python
- [MAVSDK-Swift](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Swift) - MAVSDK client for Swift.
- [MAVSDK-Java](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Java) - MAVSDK client for Java.
- [MAVSDK-JavaScript](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-JavaScript) - JS Wrapper for MAVSDK using grpc-web to generate static http client compatible with Envoy Proxy
- [Other repos](https://github.com/mavlink?q=MAVSDK) - Docs, examples, etc.
