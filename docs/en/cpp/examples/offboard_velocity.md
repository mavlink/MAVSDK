# Example: Offboard Velocity

This example shows how to how to control a vehicle in *Offboard mode* using velocity commands (in both the NED and body frames).

## Running the Example {#run_example}

The example is built and run [as described here](../examples/index.md#trying_the_examples) (the standard way).

The example terminal output should be similar to that shown below:

::: info
This is from a debug build of the SDK.
A release build will omit the "Debug" messages.

```
$ ./offboard udpin://0.0.0.0:14540
