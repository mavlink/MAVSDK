# Example: Takeoff and Land

This simple example shows the basic use of many MAVSDK features.

It sets up a UDP connection, waits for a vehicle (system) to appear, arms it, and commands it to takeoff.
After a short wait the vehicle lands.
While flying the vehicle receives telemetry. The example is implemented in C++ (only).

## Running the Example {#run_example}

The example is built and run [as described here](../examples/index.md#trying_the_examples) (the standard way).

The example terminal output should be similar to that shown below:
