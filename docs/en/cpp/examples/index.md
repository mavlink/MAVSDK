# C++ Examples

::: tip
Information about *writing* example code is covered in the [Contributing > Writing Plugins](../contributing/plugins.md) (*plugin developers* should initially create [integration tests](../contributing/plugins.md#integration_tests) rather than examples for new code).

[Offboard Velocity Control](../examples/offboard_velocity.md) | Demonstrates how to control a vehicle in Offboard mode using velocity commands (in both the NED and body frames).
[Takeoff and Land](../examples/takeoff_and_land.md) | Shows basic usage of the SDK (connect to port, detect system (vehicle), arm, takeoff, land, get telemetry)
[VTOL Transitions](../examples/transition_vtol_fixed_wing.md) | Shows how to transition a VTOL vehicle between copter and fixed-wing modes.
[Tune](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/tree/main/examples/tune) | Shows how to construct and play a tune.

The examples are "largely" built and run in the same way, as described in the following section (any exceptions are covered in the page for the associated example).

::: warning
Some of the examples define flight behaviour relative to the default home position in the simulator (e.g. [Fly Mission](../examples/fly_mission.md)).
Care should be taken if using them on a real vehicle.
:::

## Trying the Examples {#trying_the_examples}

The easiest way to test the examples is to use a [simulated PX4 vehicle](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/) that is running on the same computer.
First start PX4 in SITL (Simulation), optionally start *QGroundControl* to observe the vehicle, then build and run the example code.

::: info
The simulator broadcasts to the standard PX4 UDP port for connecting to offboard APIs (14540).
The examples connect to this port using either [add_any_connection()](../api_reference/classmavsdk_1_1_mavsdk.md#classmavsdk_1_1_mavsdk_1a405041a5043c610c86540de090626d97) or [add_udp_connection()](../api_reference/classmavsdk_1_1_mavsdk.md#classmavsdk_1_1_mavsdk_1aa43dfb00d5118d26ae5aabd0f9ba56b2).

### Setting up a Simulator

PX4 supports a [number of simulators](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/).
In order to set up the [jMAVSim](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/jmavsim.html) or [Gazebo](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/gazebo.html) simulator, you can simply follow the standard PX4 toolchain setup instructions for [macOS](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/dev_setup/dev_env_mac.html) or [Ubuntu Linux](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html).

::: info
JMAVSim can only be used to simulate multicopters.
Gazebo additionally supports a number of [other vehicles](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/gazebo.html#html#running-the-simulation) (e.g. VTOL, Rovers, fixed-wing etc.).
:::

After running a standard installation, a simulation can be started from the PX4 **/Firmware** directory using the command:
* Multicopter (jMAVSim): `make px4_sitl jmavsim`
* Multicopter (Gazebo): `make px4_sitl gazebo`
* VTOL (Gazebo):  `make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol`


### Using QGroundControl

You can use *QGroundControl* to connect to PX4 and observe vehicle movement and behaviour while the examples are running.
*QGroundControl* will automatically connect to the PX4 simulation as soon as it is started.

See [QGroundControl > Download and Install](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html) for information about setting up *QGroundControl* on your platform.


### Building the Examples {#build_examples}

To build the examples follow the instructions below, replacing *takeoff_and_land* with the name of the specific example.

The examples require the MAVSDK library to be installed.
See [installation guide](../guide/installation.md) if that is not already the case.

Then build the example:
```sh
cd examples/takeoff_and_land/
cmake -Bbuild -S.
cmake --build build -j4
```

::: info
if MAVSDK is installed locally (e.g. on Windows) you need to pass the location to cmake:

```
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=wherever_mavsdk_is_locally_installed
```
:::

### Running the Examples {#running_the_examples}

You can then run the example, specifying the connection URL as the first argument.
When running with the Simulator, you will use the connection string: `udpin://0.0.0.0:14540`

On Linux/macOS you would run the following (from the **/build** directory):
```sh
build/takeoff_and_land udpin://0.0.0.0:14540
```

For Windows you would run the following (from the **\build\Debug\** directory):
```cmd
build\Debug\takeoff_and_land.exe udpin://0.0.0.0:14540
```

::: tip
Most examples will create a binary with the same name as the example.
The name that is used is specified in the **CMakeLists.txt** file as the first value in the call to `add_executable()`.
:::

If you have already started the simulation the example code should connect to PX4,
and you will be able to observe behaviour through the SDK terminal, SITL terminal, and/or *QGroundControl*.
