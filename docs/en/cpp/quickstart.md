# C++ QuickStart

This quickstart shows you how to build and run a simple MAVSDK C++ example application against a simulated vehicle, and observe the operation using the console and in a ground station.

::: info
MAVSDK is essentially a C++ library that you can include in and link from your C++ application.
:::

## Install MAVSDK library

### Linux

**Ubuntu**

If you have an older version already installed remove that first:
```
sudo apt remove mavsdk
```

The prebuilt C++ library can be downloaded as a **.deb** from [releases](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/releases), e.g.:

```
wget https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/releases/download/v3.0.0/libmavsdk-dev_3.0.0_ubuntu24.04_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libmavsdk-dev_3.0.0_ubuntu24.04_amd64.deb
```

### macOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and use it to install the library:
```
brew install mavsdk
```

### Windows

For Windows you can download the **mavsdk-windows-x64-release.zip** file from [MAVSDK releases](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/releases) containing the headers and library and extract it locally (see [information how to use a locally installed library](guide/toolchain.md#sdk_local_install)).

For more detailed instructions or other platforms check out the [installation notes](guide/installation.md).

## Setting up a Simulator {#simulator}

The easiest way to try out MAVSDK is to run one of the MAVSDK examples against a simulated version of the vehicle.

To set up and run the PX4 simulator, you need to either [set up the PX4 SITL developer environment](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/dev_setup/dev_env.html).

Or use a [pre-built docker container to run PX4 and the simulator](https://github.com/JonasVautherin/px4-gazebo-headless):
```
docker run --rm -it jonasvautherin/px4-gazebo-headless:1.15.3
```

## Install QGroundControl

You can use *QGroundControl* to connect the simulator and observe vehicle movement and behaviour while the examples are running.
*QGroundControl* will automatically connect to the PX4 simulation as soon as it is started.

See [QGroundControl > Download and Install](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html) for information about setting up *QGroundControl* on your platform.


## Build and Try Example {#build_examples}

The examples are stored as part of the projects source code.
Get them using *git* in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK.git --recursive
cd MAVSDK
```

The examples can be found in the examples directory:
```
cd examples
```

To build the takeoff and land example, you can do:

```sh
cd takeoff_and_land/
cmake -Bbuild -S.
cmake --build build -j4
```

::: info
The examples match the MAVSDK version from your current branch. If you have another MAVSDK version installed, you should checkout the examples from that version. For example, if you have installed MAVSDK v2.x.y, you need to switch to the branch `v2`.
"""

## Running an Example {#running_the_examples}

First start PX4 in SITL (Simulation) and *QGroundControl* as described above.

Then run the example app (from the **example/takeoff_land/build** directory) as shown:
```sh
build/takeoff_and_land udpin://0.0.0.0:14540
```

The MAVSDK application should connect to PX4, and you will be able to observe the example running in the SDK terminal, SITL terminal, and/or *QGroundControl*.
The expected behaviour is shown here: [Example: Takeoff and Land](examples/takeoff_and_land.md).

::: info
The first argument above is the connection string (`udpin://0.0.0.0:14540`).
This is the standard PX4 UDP port for connecting to offboard APIs (also see [Connecting to Systems](guide/connections.md)).

## Next Steps

Once MAVSDK is installed we recommend you:
- Try the [other examples](examples/index.md)
- See how to [write your own application](guide/toolchain.md) in C++.
- Browse the [API reference](api_reference/index.md) to get an overview of the functionality.
