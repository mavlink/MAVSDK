*MAVSDK* is a collection of libraries for various programming languages to interface with [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) systems such as drones, cameras or ground systems.

The libraries provides a simple API for managing one or more vehicles, providing programmatic access to vehicle information and telemetry, and control over missions, movement and other operations.

The libraries can be used onboard a drone on a companion computer or on the ground for a  ground station or mobile device.

MAVSDK is cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows, Android and iOS.

## Programming Languages

MAVSDK is primarily written in C++ with wrappers available for several programming languages:

- [MAVSDK-C++](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK) (2016): Used in production.
- [MAVSDK-Swift](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Swift) (2018): Used in production.
- [MAVSDK-Python](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python) (2019): Used in production.
- [MAVSDK-Java](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Java) (2019): Used in production.
- [MAVSDK-Go](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Go) (2020): Proof of concept.
- [MAVSDK-JavaScript](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-JavaScript) (2019): Proof of concept.
- [MAVSDK-CSharp](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-CSharp) (2019). Proof of concept.
- [MAVSDK-Rust](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Rust) (2019): Proof of concept.

## Getting Started
